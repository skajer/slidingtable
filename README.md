# **Sliding Table  - psuedo CNC thing.**


This is a basic school project using some electronics w/ [Arduino!](https://www.arduino.cc/) ðŸ’»ðŸ¤–

## **Task**

1. Create a prototype 
2. Create a second prototype with buttons, limit switches etc.
3. Implement a prototype to a real thing! ðŸ˜Ž


## **Used components:**
* Arduino Uno R3
* L298N - Motor Driver Module
* Motor - 12V DC
* Wires
* 3D printed case
* limit switch / x2
* Power supply 12V DC
* LEDS 

## **Prototypes** ##

* Prototype 1 

    Here is the first ever idea of â€‹â€‹building this. 
    ![Prototype 1](src/photos/prototype_v1.JPG)

    Simple circuit just to test if everything is fine.


#

* Prototype 2

    Added bunch of switches, leds and more wires ðŸ˜Ž

    I also wrote a few lines of code.
